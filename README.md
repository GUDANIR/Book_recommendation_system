Book Recommender System Project
This project develops an ensemble-based book recommender system using the Book-Crossing dataset. It implements collaborative filtering techniques—user-based, item-based, and matrix factorization methods—to predict user preferences and provide book recommendations. The system is designed to address the cold-start problem for new users and optimize recommendation accuracy through an ensemble model.

Project Overview
In today's world of abundant options, personalized recommendations are crucial for helping users discover content. This project utilizes the Book-Crossing dataset, consisting of:

271,000+ books
278,000+ users
1,149,780 ratings
The goal of this project is to enhance the user experience by providing personalized book suggestions based on the user's historical ratings.

Key Features
Collaborative Filtering:
User-based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)
Item-based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
Matrix Factorization:
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with regularization
Ensemble Model: Combines the predictions from UBCF, IBCF, and Matrix Factorization to improve overall recommendation accuracy.
Cold-Start Problem: Handles new users by allowing them to provide a small number of ratings to generate personalized recommendations.

Usage
You can test the recommendation system by providing a book ISBN or a small number of ratings for a new user. The system will return top book recommendations based on the chosen collaborative filtering technique.
